    abstract: 'Executives are constantly looking for ways to find the  pulse of their
        competitive landscape along with ways to  gauge the sentiment among their
        customers. The emergence of  the Big Data movement has given businesses the
        unique  opportunity to gain perspective on these fronts, in  addition to many
        others. Amazon Web Services has placed  itself at the epicenter of this data
        movement and now  offers tools that allows decision makers to quantify their  businesses
        in ways that were previously computationally  impossible or were  prohibitively
        expensive. As a result,  with Amazon Web Services, companies now have the
        ability to  gain deep insights into customer activity, which can be  used
        as real-time feedback or guidance to make future  experiences more personalized.
