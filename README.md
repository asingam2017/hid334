   title: AWS in support of Big Data Applications and Analytics
   abstract: >
       Executives are constantly looking for ways to find the 
       pulse of their competitive landscape along with ways to 
       gauge the sentiment among their customers. The emergence of 
       the Big Data movement has given businesses the unique 
       opportunity to gain perspective on these fronts, in 
       addition to many others. Amazon Web Services has placed 
       itself at the epicenter of this data movement and now 
       offers tools that allows decision makers to quantify their 
       businesses in ways that were previously computationally 
       impossible or were  prohibitively expensive. As a result, 
       with Amazon Web Services, companies now have the ability to 
       gain deep insights into customer activity, which can be 
       used as real-time feedback or guidance to make future 
       experiences more personalized.
