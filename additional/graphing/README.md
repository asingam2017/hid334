### Fantasy Football Production Visualization 
* Mainly to familiarize myself with the Seaborn graphing library, this script will pull in the most recent fantasy football data and graph a player's production against their opportunities (touches). 
* The data source is http://fftoday.com/ and the top 50 RBs and WRs are used
* TODO: 
** Combine the results to see how different the slope is between the different types of players
** Graph text box labeling as a relative reference and not absolute

#### URLs for the different positions (included in the code as well):
* RB: http://fftoday.com/stats/playerstats.php?Season=2017&GameWeek=Season&PosID=20&LeagueID=

* TE: http://fftoday.com/stats/playerstats.php?Season=2017&GameWeek=Season&PosID=40&LeagueID=
